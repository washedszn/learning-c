# Data Structures Collection

This repository contains implementations for various data structures. Each data structure has its unique applications and is implemented with consideration for complexity and memory efficiency.

## List of Data Structures

- [x] **Linked List**: A sequential collection of elements, where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.
- [x] **Stack**: LIFO data structure with `push` and `pop` operations.
- [x] **Queue**: FIFO data structure with `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.
- [x] **Circular Queue (Ring Buffer)**: A circular variant of the queue that efficiently utilizes fixed-size storage.
- [ ] **Priority Queue**: A queue where each element has a priority, and higher priority elements are served before lower priority ones.
- [ ] **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure where each node has two children at most.
- [ ] **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree that keeps elements in sorted order, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion.
- [ ] **Heap**: A specialized tree structure that satisfies the heap property, used in priority queues.
- [ ] **Graph**: Nodes connected by edges, representing various computational problems.
- [ ] **Hash Table**: A structure that maps keys to values with fast operations using a hash function.
- [ ] **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-like structure for managing a set of strings, used in tasks like autocompletion.
- [ ] **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree, maintaining operations in O(log n) time.
- [ ] **Red-Black Tree**: Another self-balancing binary search tree with good worst-case guarantees for insertion and deletion.
- [ ] **B-Tree and B+ Tree**: Balanced tree structures for storage systems that work efficiently with large blocks of data.
- [ ] **Segment Tree**: A tree for storing intervals or segments, allowing for fast queries and updates over segment ranges.
- [ ] **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: A data structure that provides efficient methods for dynamic cumulative frequency tables.
